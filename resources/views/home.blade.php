        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            When I was eight years old I wrote my first lines of HTML.
            I was instantly hooked on web development.
            By the time I was 14, I had learned XHTML and CSS, and soon 
            was beginning JavaScript and ActionScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was 17, I began attending college and soon earned an 
            associate's degree in Web Development Technology from Rose 
            State College. After working in the field for several years,
            I returned to university and completed a bachelor's degree
            from Liberty University.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2021 I'm diving more into Laravel 8, Vue 3, the Go language
            and Fiber framework.

        <h2>Hobbies &amp; Interests</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>I'm a nerd.</strong> I love tech. On the average day I use MacOS, Windows, and Linux.
            I love learning new programming languages and frameworks, 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I'm an Oklahoman.</strong> I was born in Oklahoma, and have lived here my entire life.
            I'm excited to see Oklahoma develop a robust technology industry, while maintaining its rural
            beauty and historic landmarks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I'm a Christian.</strong> Growing up in the faith, I began learning the basics of
            Biblical Hebrew when I was eleven years old, and learned the basics of Biblical Greek
            when I was sixteen. I am ecumenical, regularly listening to theologians across the
            Christian spectrum. I have a developing interest in Church history; particularly in the
            apostolic and ante-nicene eras.
